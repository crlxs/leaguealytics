# Leaguealytics

Python project using the [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/) to scrape data from various [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/) stats websites ([OPGG](op.gg), [Game of Legends](gol.gg), [Mobalytics](mobalytics.gg) and [Lolalytics](lolalytics.com)) for analysis/game outcome prediction, mostly on a competitive/profesional level (esports) but also for "high end" SoloQ ranked games (Master+).


Be it for a fear of being wrong or simple laziness from the people in it, League's current competitive scene seems very stagnant to me; the champions, runes and itemization choices happening are always the same and very rarely challenged. Hence, I am trying to use stats to support my takes on the meta-game, while trying to not be too results-based (stats require context and are not the end-all be-all).

## TODOs

- Scrape teamwide kill/death avg for each team from gol.gg
